## About Me
A Computer Science student at the University of Warwick, UK. I created this webpage to showcase the various projects I have undertaken over the years. Software development has long been a passion of mine, and these projects are a selection of what I have done to explore such interest.
## Projects
### Car Machine Learning
*[Download](https://github.com/robert-s-reed/Car-ML/releases/download/v2021.05.03-3/20210503-3.zip) | [Repo](https://github.com/robert-s-reed/Car-ML)*

A project I initially started for fun, as an experiment into how powerful even the simplest of implementations of neural networks and machine learning could be in teaching a car to navigate a circuit. I went on to develop and expand on this over the course of three years, eventually submitting a version of it as part of my A-Level Computer Science project.
## Other
These are just small things I have done as an experiment, or for a brief bit of fun.
### Wordle
